# Greedy Algorithm
-Algo paradigm that build solution peice by piece
-in each step, choose the most obvious and immediate benefit
-fits perfectly with problem that --> best local solution lead to best global solution
-What is done in local solution, we will never going back to change them since we choose the most optimum solution on local problem

Example
-Insertion Sort
-Selection Sort
-Topological Sort
-Prim Algo
-Kruskal Algo

-Acitivity Selection Problem
-Coin Change Problem
-Fractional Knapsack Problem
